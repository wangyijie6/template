			<h1>Summary of the Ideas From the Expert</h1>
			<p>According to the email sent by Professor Gilliland, the most important role that writing plays in statistics is to let people understand what a sets of statistics stand for and what they mean. When you face a lot of statistics, you will never know what you can do with them if you have never learned statistics before. Experts in stats know how to do it, they are capable of finding out some vital data like mean, median, standard deviation, etc. Then they have to design some definitions for these specialized vocabularies so that other people can understand them as well. However, every definition must be exceptionally logical and accurate, so that people will not misunderstand it. You have to communicate with those readers and learners effectively via literacy. To make a summary for Professor Gilliland¡¯s ideas, literacy should be used accurately and cautiously to express and make definitions for some specialized vocabularies in statistics, in this way, people can understand those statistics correctly, which will eventually achieve an effective communication between those experts and the readers.</p>
