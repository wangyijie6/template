			<h1>It gets better</h1>
			<p>the purpose of the video: To tell people the disappointment that the author got, and suggests that special people also need to be understood and supported. Also, the author try to be a role model for those people in hard situations, and show them how to live a better life getting out of the problems.</p>
                        <p>How the author achieves it: The author achieves by telling his uncle¡¯s story first, and then his own. Showing those letters he wrote to his uncle show helps a lot. His speak in the video does enhance the feeling we got and let us know his emotions, while those silent white and black pics successfully bring audience to a upset world.</p>
                        <p>the structure of the message: the message bonds the story of the author and the story of the author¡¯s uncle tightly, a great link. Both of them faced similar situations while the author got better while his uncle committed suicide. This great comparison makes the title ¡° It gets better¡± really make sense.</p>
                        <p>how this video's structure can help you revise your Lived Experiences project: Maybe I can try to find out some examples which characters used to face similar situations but got different results because of the different attitudes, solutions, or emotions they take. Using this comparison can clearly show people what helps and what does not while in difficulties.</p>
