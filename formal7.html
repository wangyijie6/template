			<h1>Introduction of Specialized Words</h1>
			<p>Before we talk about how specialized vocabularies work, it is necessary to introduce some very basic specialized vocabularies and their definitions in advance. I select ¡°mean¡±, ¡°median¡±, and ¡°standard deviation¡± because they appear most frequently when trying to analyze a set of data. First of all, ¡°mean¡±. The mean, also known as average, is obtained by dividing the sum of observed values by the number of observations ("Basic Statistics: Mean, Median, Average, Standard Deviation, Z-scores, and P-value." - ControlsWiki. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Nov. 2013.). When you get the mean, you can easily have a concept of what an average level is among the given samples. Then you can judge an individual sample by comparing it with the average to see how that single one does. Next, for ¡°median¡±. The median is the middle value of a set of data containing an odd number of values, or the average of the two middle values of a set of data with an even number of values. The median is especially helpful when separating data into two equal sized bins ("Basic Statistics: Mean, Median, Average, Standard Deviation, Z-scores, and P-value." - ControlsWiki. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Nov. 2013.). As far as I have concerned, median is more meaningful than mean, because mean can easily be influenced by some extreme value for all the data has been counted, while median only counts the middle value when the amount of all the data is odd or the average of the two middle values when the total amount of the sample is even. It is to say, sometimes mean may lie about the situation while median will not. The last one, ¡°standard deviation¡±. The standard deviation gives an idea of how close the entire set of data is to the average value. Data sets with a small standard deviation have tightly grouped, precise data. Data sets with large standard deviations have data spread out over a wide range of values ("Basic Statistics: Mean, Median, Average, Standard Deviation, Z-scores, and P-value." - ControlsWiki. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Nov. 2013.). With standard deviation, you can find out how much you are above the average level, or how much you are below the average level, so that you can know your position and decide what to do next.</p>
