		<article>			<h1>Progress in formats</h1>
			<p>First of all, I have to say that I have made a huge improvement in writing formats. Before the class started, I almost had no idea with what the formats are supposed to be. Recall the time that I wrote the first draft of Project One, Lived Experience, I did not even know what quotes are, what citations are, and what should be written at the beginning of the essay (name of the student, name of the instructor, subject and class, and due date) either. When knowing these requirements from the course web, I turned to other students for help. Fortunately, those who are familiar with the writing formats answered all my questions, in addition, they told me other requirements like page header and page footer, etc. After revising my essay following those requirements above, I found my essay look totally different. Now I am quite practiced in using these formats which I was confused before.  	</p>
