		<article>			<h1>Similarities</h1>
			<p>Though these four projects may look irrelevant, they still have some interactions even if those interactions are not that apparent. The most obvious similarity is the way I wrote each project, I used the same style to write. I listed two to three pieces of material to support my opinions, and some summaries or comparisons after those examples to enhance my points of views. I believe this style works the best in introducing a personal perspective and convincing audiences of the idea from the author.</p>
<p>Then similarities in content. I talked about my personal experience in project one and some social issues in project two, so it is hard to find something common compared with other projects in contents. However, project three and project four may be the most similar within all four projects that I did. This should be no doubt because I selected the project three to be used while discussing what to do with the project four with my group members. In project three I talked about how writing achieves its role in the field of statistics. It can also be said as how people in statistics use writing to communicate with those who are not familiar with knowledge in statistics. The majority of people will agree that it is because of writing that people in different fields can communicate with each other once they do not have an opportunity to talk face to face especially in ancient times when phones and internet have not been invented. Our study group decided to write how writing works in different fields as our topic, which led me to opt project three to support that theme. In this way, the common thing between project three and project four arose.</p>
