			<h1>Ideas From An Expert</h1>
			<p>So far I have mentioned so many opinions of my own. Whereas, I am not an expert who has studied in this field for a long period of time. Because of this, I tried to get some suggestions and ideas from a professional stats researcher. Fortunately, the professor of STT 315 at MSU, Professor Dennis Gilliland, an exceptionally knowledgeable and warmhearted gentleman, was willing to help me with the topic and emailed me his points of views about writing and statistics. Here comes the email that he sent me. ¡°Generally, literacy is considered to be the ability to read and write and to listen to and speak a language at a level adequate for communication in that language. One may view effective communication in statistics as a form of literacy. It is an important part of what is called quantitative literacy. In the field of statistics, it is critical that technical and mathematical concepts be communicated effectively. We consider words to be the building blocks for communication. In quantitative literacy, the building blocks include technical terms. In quantitative literacy, the terms should convey unambiguous meanings derived from the sciences, mathematics and other disciplines. Reading, writing, listening and speaking to effectively convey quantitative concepts requires more than a fuzzy view of the words in use. The international scientific, mathematical and engineering communities provide education, clarity, standards and operational definitions that make possible the effective communication that underpins progress and invention. In statistics, many of the technical terms concern data and information. Large data sets in raw form are too massive to be read by the users so summary statistics have been developed. The summary statistics are used to communicate the important features of data. Summary statistics include mean, median, percentiles, standard deviation and z-scores.  Many graphical methods have been developed to aide in the communication of data and their important features.  The graphical methods include pie charts, bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, dot plots, stem-and-leaf displays, box plots and scatterplots. Effective communication in statistics requires an understanding of the meanings of many technical terms and a mastery of the tools and methods mentioned above.  A start at acquiring effective communication capability in statistics comes from formal study not unlike that required to learn a foreign language.  A vocabulary of terms and words is built while the understanding of their use is maturing. The American Statistical Association in writing about curricula in statistics states that ¡®Effective statisticians at any level display a combination of skills that are not exclusively mathematical.¡¯ and that ¡®Graduates should be expected to write clearly, speak fluently, and have developed skills in collaboration and teamwork and organizing and managing projects¡¯. It recognizes that education should ¡®Offer frequent opportunities to develop communication skills¡¯.¡±</p>
