                <p>1</p>
                <p>How did the issue you chose affect your composing for the project?</p>
                <p>I have to focus more on how writing works in literacy, how it helps people.</p>
                <p>2</p>
                <p> How did composing for this issue help you to better understand the issue at hand?</p>
                <p>I understood the theme of writing of literacy in statistics after doing this project by interviewing some professors.</p>
                <p>3</p>
                <p>What problems did you encounter in organizing and composing your documentary? </p>
                <p>Group members are from different fields, so we may have different concepts and different ideas when discussing.</p>
                <p>4</p>
                <p>What role did audience play?</p>
                <p>Hearers and watchers because we are making a video.</p>
                <p>5</p>
                <p>How did you select the issue/topic you chose? </p>
                <p>We decided to talk about the formal research because it is about our majors, which we are most familiar with in academic.</p>
                <p>6</p>
                <p>What was the most challenging part of the project for you? Why?</p>
                <p>I have to interview the professor, fortunately he was willing to get it and told me a lot of things which helped me in the project.</p>
                <p>7</p>
                <p>Did you take a systematic approach?</p>
                <p>I did. We got a common topic and decided to make the project with different material but have the same theme after discussing. Then we made the video.</p>
                <p>8</p>
                <p>Which research resources proved to be the most beneficial for you? </p>
                <p>Advises from the professor. His advises did help a lot for he is a professional one in statistics. You can learn a lot from his advises. Also, his advises are absolutely convincing.</p>
                <p>9</p>
                <p>Which ones proved to be the least beneficial?</p>
                <p>Maybe those analyses from two selected articles. Because they are just two from a lot. I mean, maybe they cannot represent all the articles which have the same style.</p>
                <p>10</p>
                <p>Describe the interaction of your group in completing this project?</p>
                <p>Though we are from different fields, we have to write. In other words, the same tool works in our fields, that is, writing. We write for we need to communicate and record.</p>
                <p>11</p>
                <p>Was working in groups for this project fruitful? Why or why not?</p>
                <p>Of course. Because it always lets you learn a lot when you discuss with people from different majors. In this way you can be insightful then you were.</p>
                <p>12</p>
                <p>How well did you plan your work on this project?</p>
                <p>I think I did pretty well. I revised my project 3 carefully, which is my selected one. I took out those which I think are important and then make it a summary.</p>
                <p>13</p>
                <p>If you were to do it over again or if you had had more time, what might you have done differently?  </p>
                <p>I may add some other ways to express our topics. Not only the video but maybe add some things else like images, conversations, etc.</p>
                <p>14</p>
                <p>What is the most effective aspect of your documentary¡¯s effectiveness or design? Why?</p>
                <p>Maybe the meaning of writing. I mean how writing works in different fields. It is the most important thing in my documentary.</p>
                <p>15</p>
                <p> How did you make your design decisions?</p>
                <p>I think making a video is the most direct way to show people what people think. Also, it is a way full of technology, which is the topic of the WRA110.</p>
                <p></p>
