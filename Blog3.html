		<article>			<h1>In Class Activity 3£ºImported From Detroit</h1> <p></p>
                        <p>Imagery of Detroit£ºThere are some famous buildings in Detroit get involved in the commercial. Such as the Fist, the Ford Field, and the Fox Theater, where Eminem stops his car and get in at the end of the commercial. These buildings are symbols of Detroit, they represent the Motor City, also the spirit of blue collar. In this way, people live in or come from Detroit will feel proud when they see these in the commercial, which may persuade them to buy the car, the Chrysler 300C.</p>
<p>Inclusion of Eminem ¡°Lose Yourself¡±£ºActually this rap was for the movie, ¡°8 mile¡±, which talks about how Eminem became such a successful rapper and got out of the ghetto area. The story is inspiring, and so is the rap. Listening to this rap while watching this commercial, those audiences may feel motivated to buy the car, also those who are in Detroit may want to bring their Motor City out of the trouble by buying the car, and that is what the Chrysler intends to see.</p>
<p>Tagline, ¡°Imported from Detroit¡±£ºAlthough Detroit has been suffering a lot these years, it is still known as the Motor City. Cars imported from Detroit are proud of where they come from. Cars from Detroit represent high quality, safety, and the most important one, the toughness, which is also the spirit of Detroit, where most citizens are blue collars who have this kind of spirit. In this way, the Chrysler can proudly announce that, these cars are imported from Detroit.</p>
