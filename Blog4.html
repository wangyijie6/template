<p>That was my first time attending the WRA 110 course. I was not there the first class at the end of August because I did not enroll that course at that time. Immediately I found the course would not be easy for it had a lot of requirements that I had to do. However, I was still confident and believed that I can do it.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">09.12.2013</p>
<p>Though I was confident about the course, I felt it was not easy to face the course alone. So I wanted to have a WRA110 study group. I made friends with some students who were also from China. Actually I wanted to have some American members but I was not able to communicate well with them because my English was not good enough. Sometimes I could not really understand them when they speak so fast and could not get their humor because of the differences in culture. This phenomenon made me upset.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">09.19.2013</p>
<p>The first project, Lived Experience was due that day but I did not finish my final draft so I need to hurry up. Meanwhile, the second project was coming, the Cultural Analysis. I guessed this project was easy to write because it was about cultural things. I came from a country whose culture is totally different from the American culture, I was really excited because I guessed I just got the opportunity to introduce some culture and social issues in China to those classmates.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">09.26.2013</p>
<p>Class cancelled.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">10.03.2013</p>
<p>We got the second in-class activity today. Before doing it, we had to watch a movie about social network, and the movie talked about the most popular social tool nowadays-Facebook. We almost spent the whole class watching it though it was still not enough. So we would watch the rest of the movie next time we came for class.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">10.10.2013</p>
<p>At the beginning of the class, we finished watching the movie talked about Facebook which we had not finished watching last time. The rest of the time was for us to finish the Cultural Analysis project. I got some new ideas in my mind which I guessed were much better than those I got in my rough draft. So I decided to write a totally new essay instead of revising my rough draft.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">10.17.2013</p>
<p>Today we were asked to do the library activity, which was prepared for the third project, Formal Research. I found that activity really troublesome but I still had to do it and it was due at the midnight. So I forced myself to finish the project. The process was tough.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">10.24.2013</p>
<p>The Formal Research project was really challenging. First of all it was the longest project we were asked to do this semester. The length of the essay should be at least 2,700 word. Besides, we were asked to do an interview. Finally, I decided to write an email to the professor of STT315, which I was taking this semester, and asked for his advises.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">10.31.2013</p>
<p>We were told to continue the formal research project. Some classmates were talking about their Halloween plan. Though it is my second year studying in US, I am still not able to enjoy those festivals that I have never experienced in my life before.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">11.07.2013</p>
<p>Today the instructor introduced us the fourth project, Multimedia Remix. My group decided to make a video and talk about how writing works in our own majors. We also started the in-class activity 3 today, which made me extremely excited. Because we were asked to analyze the commercial ¡°Imported from Detroit¡±, the advertisement for the Chrysler 300. I got excited because the commercial was acted by my favorite rapper since middle school, Eminem. I have watched the commercial for at least 20 times before the course. Easy for me to introduce to my group members who were not familiar with that.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">11.14.2013</p>
<p>The due date for the Multimedia project was changed to after the thanksgiving. However, we got to start the final project, course retrospective. I got no idea about how to write the project, and finally, I decided to talk about my progress made this semester and introduce the course to those who are taking WRA course in the next semester in addition.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">11.21.2013</p>
<p>I was upset because I forgot to put my rough draft of the final project on D2L as I had already finished that before the due date. However, I was the one who should be responsible for it. I have to take this experience and never do that again. There is a Chinese old saying, you learn from something which makes you hurt.</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">11.28.2013</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
<p style="color:green;font-family:Cursive">12.05.2013</p>
<p>That was the last course this semester. I was really tired because our multimedia group did not finished the video until 2am yesterday. So I guessed I just sleep for less than 5 hours for I had class before the WRA course in the morning. I wished I could have a great ending for this WRA110. There was also a Chinese old saying that you should also try you best to end it if you tried your best to start it. That was what I was pursuing.</p>		</article>
