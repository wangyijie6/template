			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>As far as I have concerned, the instance of Way of Wade can strongly prove the fact that how much celebrity branding is able to affect a brand and customers. Customers sometimes, especially those young customers, do not really care about the quantities of products. What they do care about is who advertise for the products. When their favorite stars do endorsement for a product, it is no doubt that they will buy it, blindly exactly. It has already became a social issue that is clear to everyone. Sometimes this kind of phenomenon may benefit young generations, for example, if these popular stars suggest that it is good to go to library and study or go to gym for fitness, kids are really likely to follow these suggestions and get benefit by doing these. Nevertheless, if those stars advertise for some bad things like alcohol and tobacco, and enjoy them in the ad, young guys may become motivated to try these harmful things just for imitating and finally get addicted.</p>
<p>There is another upset information about the effect of celebrity in China. Edison Chan, who has been regarded the father of ¡°swag¡± in China, is amazingly popular among Chinese young generations. The way he wears, the way he talks have all become parts of fashion in China, even if he did not do these thinks on purpose at all. However, just few years ago, his scandals was discovered by media. Hundreds of photos that he took while he had sex with plenty of famous stars were showed to public. Nevertheless, his fans, especially his young fans, still think it is cool. They do not think that Edison Chen is doing bad things like promiscuity. Some teens even imitate what he did, of course, they regretted finally. This is an example that telling all of us that celebrities sometimes may mislead teens. Teens are not mature enough and do not have the ability to judge an event. If they just imitate what those superstars did, even those bad things, it may destroy their lives and future, which the society is not willing to see at all.</p>		</article>
