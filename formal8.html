			<h1>How Writing Works In Statistics</h1>
			<p>What¡¯s more, it is widely known that there are a lot of graphic methods developed to classify data like pie charts, bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, dot plots, stem-and-leaf displays, box plots and scatterplots. It is hard to find someone who has never studied in statistics but can get information from these graphs easily. In this way, those experts still need to explain how those graphs are made and what they mean, of course, by literacy. For example, when a box plot is shown, those who have never learned statistics before are not capable of understanding what the graph means, so those who learned it should explain it. Experts should tell them what the outlier is, what the interquartile range is, and where is the median in the graph. In addition, experts should also tell audiences what these words stand for and why they are important when analyzing data. All the above steps can only be expressed by writing when face to face communication is not available. For this, experts should have a writing style which is very accurate, very specific and easy to understand, and of course not ambiguous. With this style, audiences will not confused with those graphs and get the core of the graph with ease.</p>
