			<h1 style="color:green">Importance of Stat</h1>
			<p>Not only does statistic work in the situation above, but it also plays plenty important roles in business. Every company has to plan for their future selling strategy, and review their sales record last year or last season. How can they do it? The most direct way is to check the selling data last year. For example, if I were the general manager, I would consider the monthly average sales as very significant information. I would try to find out which month is the most popular month for the product and which month is the least popular month for the product. By knowing this, I may change the production according to popularity in different months so that the product will not be either out of stock or too many in stock. Also, I could change the price according to the data. I would like to raise the price when the demand peaks, and in opposite cut the price when demand is at its lowest. In short, to make decisions according to data analyze in statistic ways is most likely to maximize the profit for the company and decrease the risk of failing the business.</p>
