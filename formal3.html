			<h1 style="color:green">Magazine Analysis</h1>
			<p>I also found an article from a magazine which talks about stats as well. It is called ¡°DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULT URAL STATISTICS." (Prairie Farmer (1843-1877) Jun 26 1875: 204. ProQuest. Web. 24 Oct. 2013. ). This article talks about how to plan for more efficient advertisements that are good for companies As soon as you see the formats, it is easy to find the differences compared to the scholarly one. It divides the whole article into several parts, and gives each part a subhead. Each part starts with a huge amount of quotes from other books, which in order to make the article look convincing to its audiences, and prove the theory that it is going to indicate as well. With this kind of relaxing style, even those audiences who are not familiar with the field can learn a lot and understand. Also. They may find the part which interest them very quickly. Obviously, this essay is for those readers who may be interested in stats, but do not know much about this field yet. It does not have a very deep discussion about a specific topic in stats, but covers a wide range of knowledge about stats. What¡¯s more, it is not like the former one which talks a lot and only talks about academic things about stats, however, it talks about using stat as a tool to achieve a goal in daily lives. It tells how to utilize stats. It is certainly that most people are more interested in how to use it instead of discussing stats just academically. To sum up, this article is closer to daily lives, to people who are not experts or who are not majoring in stats. It is for people who want to just learn about stats and know how to use it.</p>
