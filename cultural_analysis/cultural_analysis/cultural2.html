			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Nowadays sneakers have been widely recognized as a vital part of fashion. Some popular sneakers, like Air Jordans and Air Lebrons, those limited editions in particular, can be sold for thousands times of their retails, and you need to wait in line for a whole night to buy them(Hundreds Wait in Line for Release of New Air Jordans - Atlanta News, Weather, Traffic, and Sports | FOX 5. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Oct. 2013).</p><p>Li-ning company and Way of Wade.</p>           <p>Li-ning, one of the most famous sports brands in China, ( Lining.com - Li Ning Company Limited. Lining.com - Li Ning Company Limited. N.p., n.d. Web. 09 Oct. 2013.) was established by the former Olympics gymnastic champion Mr. Li Ning(Li Ning. Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, 10 May 2013. Web. 09 Oct. 2013.) in 1988. Like Michael Jordan, Mr. Li used to be an exceptionally popular player and the pride of China. However, nearly thirty years passed, young generations have grown up, and they do not really consider Mr. Li as a really cool guy. Though Li-ning company worked really hard in designing good quality sneakers and clothes, they are not really prevalent among customers. Even those sports company whose products are worse than Li-ning¡¯s but with more well-known celebrities advertise for them were more popular. It seemed that something must happen to take Li-ning company to the correct track( SportsBusiness Daily. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Oct. 2013).</p><p>In the summer of 2012, a breaking news about Li-ning shocked all the people who love sneakers. Li-ning signed a contract with the NBA superstar from Miami Heat, Dwayne Wade. Though Li-ning has signed some players in NBA such as Evan Turner from Philadelphia 76ers and Jose Calderon from Dallas Mavericks, they cannot be compared with Dwayne Wade, a top-ten player in NBA who had won NBA championship twice at that time (three now), it is so easy to imagine how popular he is When that happens, everybody was looking forward to seeing his shoes made by Li-ning("BREAKING: Dwayne Wade Signs with Li-Ning." N.p., Oct.-Nov. 2012. Web. 17 Oct. 2013).</p>  <p>Li-ning released a pair of sneakers called Way of Wade (Way of Wade. Way of Wade. N.p., n.d. Web. 09 Oct. 2013.) when NBA season begins in 2012, and caught people¡¯s eyes in a very short period of time. The Way of Wade not only looked fantastic on the surface, but also used the best material and the best skills to produce them. The first batch of Way of Wade were sold out just in weeks, which showed that customers did love them. After that Li-ning released some very limited editions and people waited in line to buy time. This scene has never happened on any other brand besides Air Jordans. Li-ning and Dwayne Wade¡¯s cooperation made this happen on Li-ning, a brand which was not popular even in China. Now people sell Way of Wade even on Ebay worldwide and the price is much higher than their retails in China.</p>		</article>
