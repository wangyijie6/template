			<p>Not only have I made progress in writing formats, but also in how to write an essay as well. I used find that I was lack of inspirations when I got a project. I did not know what to write. The main reason was likely to be that I did not have sufficient material in my mind as a result of not paying enough attention on accumulating material in my daily life. This was an indeed serious problem because your essay comes from your lived experiences. You use your material to prove your theory or anything else that you want to let your audiences to feel. I started to do something useful to change it after class of course, but some activities in class also helped a lot with the mentioned problem. We have watched several videos in class, and each of them was from different field of topics. Some talked about scientific discoveries, some talk about social issues, and also some talked about personal story. Although some guys thought these activities were useless, I considered them as a kind of accumulation. We got material from different fields, and tolerant the situation that getting a project which we may not feel that familiar with. What¡¯s more, we can also learn the way those videos tried to express their themes and theories. We can demonstrate them. Everything starts from demonstration. </p>
<p>By doing these activities in the past two months, I wrote my essay much more logically and convincingly. The order of paragraphs in my essay did not come randomly, every paragraph has a reason to be at that position. They have their functions to either prove or introduce the following paragraphs as well as to make a summary for the paragraphs above. That is what I mean logical.</p>
<p>The most significant progress I made was that I started to write my essay more structured. I know how to bond all my material and my opinions together in a logical and convincing way now. It is similar to building construction. The process of build a house with all its material is absolutely vital. When this step does not look really skillful, all the material do not make sense no matter how good they are. Thus, it is not hard to imagine how excited I got when finding my progress in this aspect.</p>
