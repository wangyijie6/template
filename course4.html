		<article>			<h1 style="color:green">About each project</h1>
			<p>To be specific in contents of each project. In this semester, we have been given four major projects to work with. The degree of difficulty is getting higher and higher. However, this method works well indeed, because I do feel my progress by studying this way.</p>
<p>The first project was Lived Experience. We were requested to write a paper about how we got attracted by a type of technology in a certain field, which we chose as our majors in this university.</p>
<p>The second project was Cultural Analysis. We had to write the situation of a existing social issue by observing an artificial in our daily lives. Then we should find out a way or give some proper suggestions to solve or how to deal with the social issue.</p>
<p>Then there came the project three, also the longest one, Formal Research. This project asked us to talk about how literacy works in a certain field. In addition, we have to find out some articles from the selected field, and then analyze their writing styles in order to find how the writing style should be in that field. After that, we also needed to interview an expert in that field, and get his opinions about how writing works in that discipline. I felt fruitful after doing this project because not only did I communicate and get help from the expert, but also improved my recognition towards writing.</p>
<p>The fourth project was the Multimedia Remix Project, which actually did not have too much deal with writing skills, so I will not talk about it in this paper.</p>
