			<h1 style="color:green">Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>For Jordans</p><p>Why did that happen? There are a lot of reasons. Maybe they think these shoes are cool, look nice, or maybe those buyers just consider these shoes as symbols of so called swag. They may do not really love these shoes, they just want to be so-called swaggers. And above all, what is the most effective reason that make this phenomenon happen? What make them think that they look swag when they are in these shoes? Who make a definition for the word swag? In my perspective, celebrity branding make a significant role in it. For example, who is the one that advertise for Air Jordans? Everybody knows the answer, Michael Jordan, who has been recognized as the greatest player in the history of NBA. (Michael Jordan Biography. Bio.com. A&E Networks Television, n.d. Web. 09 Oct. 2013.) How was him able to make this brand that popular? On the one hand, before he played in NBA, though there were a lot of great African American players like Magic Johnson and Bill Russell, audiences, especially those white ones still always reminded themselves of the races of these players, and they did not intend to admit that African Americans could do well in this field. However, unbelievable performances by Michael Jordan shocked all those audiences who watched NBA games, even those white audiences admired Michael Jordan and became his fans. In this way, African American became proud of Michael Jordan and were fond of wear his shoes. On the other hand, just as I have mentioned above, for Michael did so well in NBA, a huge amount of people became his fans, and believed that they became Michael Jordan when they wore Michael Jordan¡¯s shoes when they were on the court. To sum up, if Nike did not sign Michael Jordan for the endorsement, Air Jordans would not become that popular even if those great designs and products did not change at all. It is because of Michael Jordan did the celebrity branding that this brand become such a popular one.</p><p>Now the same explaination for Way of Wade</p><p>As a customer who used to buy some products by Li-ning and also the Way of Wade, I found that people became interested in Li-ning not really because of their skills in producing sneakers or technologies in products. As a matter of fact, these things did not change at all. What changed is that Li-ning signed Dwayne Wade and named a pair of shoes using name of Wade. As a result of it, attitudes of customers changed a lot and the development of Li-ning, or its destiny in other words, got totally changed. </p>
