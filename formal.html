		<article>			<h1>Introduction of the discipline</h1>
			<p>Although my registered major is supply chain management, I did not do research in this field. There are two main reasons. First of all, I do not have sufficient credits to apply for entering the business college, while courses about supply chain management can only be taken by students in the business college. I have not started to learn this major yet so I do not think I am qualified to introduce this major. Secondly, I am learning STT 315, which focuses on introducing probability and statistic for business. I found this course interesting and did quite good with it so I am quite familiar with it now. Meanwhile all the students who want to enter the business school have to study it. Above all. I decided to take this discipline as my topic.</p><p>When talk about statistics, it is no doubt that a lot of people will think of things such as numbers, forms, and so forth. Of course these are significant elements in statistics, nevertheless, how to describe the results that you gain from stats is also necessary to learn about. I found two articles from the internet, one is a scholarly essay, while the other is from a magazine, I am going to analyze them and figure out the differences between these two essays which are in the same discipline.</p>
