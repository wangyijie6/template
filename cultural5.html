			<p>Therefore, society and also those famous stars should be aware of how much these superstars affect people, young generations in particular. Some specific policies should be set about it. For example, superstars should be forbidden to advertise for products like alcohol and tobacco, or set a ceiling for the income these stars will get from advertise for products like these. Meanwhile, society is responsible to tell those stars what they should do and what is right for them to do. Society should educate these stars how affective they can be and persuade them to be role models for young generations. Tell them that their behaviors may be able to change a kid¡¯s life. Encourage them to do more public service advertisements which suggest people to do things in right ways</p><p>What¡¯s more, we should not only put all the responsibilities to these stars, we should think about why these stars are so affective among people. In my perspective, it is something about education. If we educated people that we should set a correct standard not only depends on what superstars do, the celebrity branding should not had that big effects on people. We should tell our young generations to follow what they think is right not just follow or imitate those superstars blindly for these superstars may also do things wrong or make mistakes. They are human beings after all. People should be able to judge something they encountered and this kind of ability can only come from education. Schools should pay more attention to it. Schools have to communicate and educate young kids properly instead of criticize or prevent them directly, which may cause some unexpected results.</p>
