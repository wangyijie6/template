			<h1>Scholarly Essay Analysis</h1>
			<p>I am now starting with the scholarly essay. The name of the essay is ¡°Assessing the Introduction of a Computer Laboratory Experience into a Behavioral Science Statistics Course ¡°(Raymondo, James C., and James R. Garrett. "Assessing the Introduction of a Computer Laboratory Experience into a Behavioral Science Statistics Course." Teaching Sociology 26.1 (1998): 29-37. ProQuest. Web. 24 Oct. 2013.). The essay is focusing on telling us the major statistics and what the statistics suggest. After reading it, it is not hard to find out that, as a scholarly essay, the style is indeed formal and professional. Those statements are concise, almost no useless describing sentences. Meanwhile, the essay is apparently written for those who are familiar with this field such like stats experts and researchers. It contains a lot of professional words in the field of statistics such as ¡°mean¡± and ¡°expectation¡±, and some letters that stand for things that can only be understood in statistics such as ¡°N¡±, which stands for sample. By guessing who those audiences are, we may draw a conclusion that the purpose of this essay may be announcing some new academic discoveries in stats. In addition, the writer is really cautious. In order to make the theories convincing, the author used plenty citations. For example, ¡°Anderson, R. A., L. M. Issel, and R. R. McDaniel, Jr. 1997. "Nursing Staff Turnover in Nursing Homes: A New Look." Public Administration Quarterly 21 (1): 69-95.¡± These citations suggests that those theories which were used to support the new one has already been proved, and the readers do not need to doubt about them. To sum up, this scholarly essay strongly focuses on academic topics and results, with few useless descriptions, and is exceptionally logical.</p>		</article>
