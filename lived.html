                <p>As a student whose major is supply chain management, which people are not really familiar with, I am responsible to introduce the major supply chain management to everyone who gets confused about it.¡°Supply chain management (SCM) is the management of an interconnected or interlinked between network, channel and node business involved in the provision of product and service packages required by the end customers in a supply chain. Supply chain management spans the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods from point of origin to point of consumption. It is also defined as the "design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand and measuring performance globally. SCM draws heavily from the areas of operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology, and strives for an integrated approach.¡¯¡¯ £¨"Supply Chain Management." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, 09 Oct. 2013. Web. 11 Sept. 2013.£©.For the society is developing rapidly, supply chain management has become a vital part in the field of business. Only with agile, sensitive, flexible and well-organized supply chains can those companies win clients from all over the world in this competitive market.</p>
	        <p>A lot of people consider supply chain management as a fuzzy word which is hard to find out in our daily lives. It is true that this field needs to be seek for carefully, and in this way you can find it everywhere. Here comes an example of supply chain management which contains the most attractive topic these recent years, the releasing of great sneakers such as limited Air Jordans or other ones like Lebrons, etc. When the release date approaches, producers have to transport these shoes according to sizes to local Footlocker, Finishline, or other branch of sports shops. It is no doubt that these stocks will be sold out in a very short period of time. After that, those customers who still want to buy these shoes have to check stores online to see if there are some available in other branches, or ask the local branch to get one pair from those branches that still have some. Then, if the goods are still demanded in the market, stores will restock them maybe several months later. Goods need to flow to where customers want them, so how to allocate the resources like labor and devices a firm has becomes a kind of knowledge. To control the cost and increase the efficiency with the management of sellers is one part of supply chain management. Also. Supply chain includes other fields like storage management, packaging and so forth. However, no matter how extensive the supply chain management is, all the things above should be with the help of the development of technologies. It is to say, all of these situations will not happen without the science, advanced technologies and devices. These things are the preconditions, and they play vital roles in the development of supply chain management.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact I was not interested in supply chain management at all at the very beginning and I even did not know what the major was all about. At that time I intended to choose marketing as my major for I thought marketing was more suitable for me and was easier to get a job in the future. </p>
                <p>However, I totally changed my mind after an unforgettable visiting to the factory of Nike of China, which located in Taicang, Jiangsu Province. The most impressive thing that I saw is the technology of storage management, which has made an unbelievable impact on my career. Though it is widely known that Nike has a tremendous production especially in China, a country which has a population of 13 hundred million, Nike allocated their storages, supply chains as logical as possible in order to run the company with guaranteeing the quality of products at the lowest cost. They do it by using the most advanced tech of storage management. Workers in the factory worked by the pipeline controlled by computers in great orders and got those goods out of those storages to those transportations. Products were transported by automatic bearings, which are also manipulated by computer. Everything was going on under great orders. Using those high technical devices both in the factory and at the supply chain, managers and workers organized those suppliers, producers, storages, allocators, and local sellers to run the business effectively. All these things made the company capable of making responses real quick according the demands from clients. Time flies, a lot of celebrated brands collapsed no matter how brilliant they used to be, while Nike still stands on the top of its all area. Outstanding supply chains must be one of those reasons why Nike can beat a lot of competitive opponents in its history and run a sustainable business then finally become a well-known legend in the past since it established in 1978.</p>
                <p>The effect of this trip, or of the technology in specific, was that it made me pay more attention to the field of supply chain management and curious about the techs firms use to maximize their profits. The factory made such a large amount of storages well organized and get products and translate them efficiently and with few errors. How amazing it was! Nowadays the environments of business has brought firms with great pressure. Not only do they have to provide clients with excellent products, but also with satisfying services, in order to improve customers¡¯ satisfaction so that they feel good. In this way, supply chain managers have to respond real quickly according to demands from customers, and with the lowest cost and the biggest revenue via utilizing the system of supply chain. Also, as the consuming level of keeps going up, the demand will certainly goes up as well. More and more transactions will happen online which requires a riper supply chain system to transport the things they purchase from every corner of the world so that the global economic will not stop developing. This is how supply chain management functions and how important it is in the future for the world¡¯s development. I started to realize that there was a lot fun in the knowledge of supply chain management , and it would also became a great major for me to take.</p>
                <p>Since I decided to take supply chain management as my major, I started to observe every aspect that involves supply chain management. As we all know, supply chain management is not a narrow field, it includes many small branches like storing, logistics, and so forth. As a student, I find logistics most relevant to my daily life. I prefer shopping online rather than go to stores and pick up so I always get packages from usps, which is what logistics do. Nevertheless, this is something that is really easy to see. That is what I have talked about in the second paragraph. When you try to think deeply, you will find the system of supply chain everywhere in your life. </p>
                <p>Thinking of the current situation of supply chain management that the extensively land of China and the developing status of the field of supply chain management, I began to confident about the decision I made to study supply chain management. It is predictable that supply chain management is a field with great promising, for those developing countries which are not familiar with it like China or India in particular. So now it is easy to see why I decided to choose supply chain management. There are plenty of spaces and opportunities to develop in China after I graduating which means that I would probably have a bright future with choosing this major.. </p>
                <p>All the things started when I got shocked by those advanced devices in the Nike factory and I decided happily to start my career as a member of supply chain management. I am looking forward to have a witness of other fascinating techs on my way of studying that major and hope that I can have a fantastic career with supply chain management.</p>
