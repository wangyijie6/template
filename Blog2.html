		<article>			<h1>In Class Activity 2</h1><h2 style="color:Green">The Effect of Technology upon Communication and Writing</h2><ol><li>For communication, it is because of technologies like Facebook and Twitter appeared that people became able to communicate not only face to face but also be in different places via using internet no matter how far the distance is, which solves the problem that people may cannot tell others what they are thinking about as soon as they get the idea just because they are not at the same place. What¡¯s more, when people see some interesting images, they can just show others by using the function ¡°share¡± or ¡°at¡±. In these ways, they do not need to imitate to sing or draw the same things that they think are interesting.</li><li>For writing, as people became to write blogs which others can see, people started to notice their skills of writing because they do not want those audience to laugh at what he wrote or look down upon their skills. Therefore, those who are fond of writing blogs spend more time studying how to become a good writer, which may lead to some trends and reactions.</li></ol>
