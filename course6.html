			<p>Just like what I said, the project that gave me the most unforgettable impression must be the project three, formal research. I wrote about statistics, which I am studying this season and must take the course if I am sure to continue my career in business. In this project, I got the biggest amount of material to write ever. First of all, I got two articles, one of them was a scholarly essay talked about statistics, and the other one also talked about statistics but was from a magazine. I had to analyze these two articles from different sources, and tried to find out a certain regulation for writing style choosing. I also got a lot of brilliant opinions from the professor of the STT 315, which talks about probability and statistic in business, at MSU. As an expert, he told me a lot of thoughts which made me exceptionally inspired. Those he told me were all his experiences that he got from his over 35 year career. I felt so lucky to know this at the age of nineteen. I analyzed the mentioned material step by step, and put them in a logical order. With these two kinds of useful information, I drew my own conclusions and my thoughts in this field as well. </p>
<p>The project three was the most structured one that I have ever made. It was requested to be the longest project so it became much more difficult to write it in a correct logic. Every sentence and paragraph should not be nonsense. They should be reasonable and prepared for the following content and details. When I finished my project three I felt that was what I pursued for. An essay in logical order although it is very long. Then I realized that was the progress I made during the process of studying. If I had not taken the course, I would not be able to write like that. </p>
